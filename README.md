#Classic arcade game clone

##Project Overview
This project tries to accomplish the goal of using object-oriented javascript to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger. The main concepts in object-oriented programming applied here are: prototype delegation, scopes, code reuse and the use of the keyword "this".

##Installation
Clone the git repository and open the index.html file in your browser
```
$ git clone https://github.com/leonardo384/classic-arcade-game.git
$ cd classic-arcade-game
```

##Instructions:
* Initially the player has five lives
* The player can move freely on the green area
* To move the player use the arrows.
* Try to avoid the bugs. Whenever a bug hits the player, the player loses a life.
* The player scores by taking a star.
* A new star will appear in a new location on the stone area
* If the player touches the water (upper blue area) it loses one point. 
* The game ends when the player loses its five lives.
* You can play [here](http://leonardomartinez.co/classic-arcade-game/)
* Good luck!
